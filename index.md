## PROJECT 5

```markdown
Learning Objectives:

1. Gain experience working with classes, including 
   class constructors and methods
2. Gain experience interpreting existing code to 
   design a new class, including constructor and methods
3. Gain more experience working with code modules
4. Gain experience executing and debugging Node.js 
   code using VSCode, including module breakpoints
5. Gain more experience working with Array map() 
   and forEach() methods
6. Gain experience working with the concept of 
   a gaming loop
7. Gain more experience working with objects/arrays

Overview: 

For this project, you will create a Monster Game 
program using classes. The game will create monsters 
with initial life values, and minimum life values for 
the monster to be alive. Once the game is running, each 
monster's life will be drained by a random amount, and 
the game will continue until all of the monsters have died. 
The game will include a delay before each life drain.

```

### Technologies Used:
- VS Code
- Terminal


### What I Learned:
In this project, I created a Moster Game using the class constructor. Some methods I used were *listMonsters()* method, *forEach()* method, *createMonsters()* method, and *playGame()* method.
